This directory contains an extension module to allow Perl5 programs
access the Iris GL library supplied by SGI with the IRIX system.

This module requires the GL library to be installed (e.g. the file
/usr/lib/libgl.so, which is part of the eoe1.sw.gfx_lib package in
IRIX 5.2, it may very well be under another name in other versions of
IRIX)

This package uses MakeMaker in a standard way to build its Makefile.
In order to build it do the following:

1. Unpack the source into a directory

2. change the current directory to the source directory

3. run "perl Makefile.PL"

4. run "make"

5. run "make install" as someone who can write to your Perl library
   directory.

The current implementation is NOT complete - functions and constants
are being added to it as I need them.  If you want me to add a
particular function from the Iris GL library then please drop me a
note and I'll try to do what you want.

Most of the functions are extremly trivial to support so you shouldn't
be too scared to try to add what you need yourself, but please let me
know about what you do so I can maintain a single version for the
benefit of all users (all two of them :-).

Notice that the Font Manager routines are not included in this module,
a separate module exists for them (call 'SGI::FM').

Usage is stright-forward - just add a 'use SGI::GL' command before using
any of the functions then call them as you would call GL functions
from C, prefixing the function names with 'SGI::GL::'.

A tiny examples sub-directory is supplied, try it.  The "zdraw.pl"
exmaple will show how to use the "rectf" function through this module.
It also shows you how to avoid typing the SGI::GL:: extensions.
